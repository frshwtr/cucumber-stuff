# What is this?

This is a store of the exercises that make up [The Cucumber Book](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwcuc2/the-cucumber-book-second-edition/) by Matt Wynne and Aslak Hells√∏y.

I am not a Ruby expert, in fact this is my very first attempt at Ruby! Any feedback or tips on my code are greatly appreciated. Feel free to open an issue with any feedback :)
